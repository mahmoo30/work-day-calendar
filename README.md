# Work Day Calendar
## A Simple Calendar Application
### Users Can Use this Application to Plan for their Hourly Events in a 9AM-5PM Work Day

## User Story:
As an employee with a busy schedule I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

## How It Works:
When you open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. <br>
When you scroll down, you will be presented with time blocks for standard business hours: 9AM-5PM. <br>
Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green). <br>
You can click into a time block and enter an event into each to plan your day. <br>
Click the save button for that time block to save it into the local storage. <br>
Refreshing the browser will not delete the saved items. <br>
The information entered will be saved on the page until 12AM the next day, after which the it will be automcatically deleted and the application will be ready for use for the next day. <br>
The clear button is available for use to delete all saved items and clear the time blocks.
